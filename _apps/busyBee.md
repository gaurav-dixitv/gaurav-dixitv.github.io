feature0Desc: "Profiles are custom configurations that can be set for a specific duration or a geofenced area and will handle all calls for that period/area.</br>
For example, you can create a 'movies' profile that is designed to answer your calls when you enter the theater or when you set it for the duration of the movie.</br></br>

feature1Desc: "BusyBee runs as a background service and stays dormant for most of it's running cycle. It registers itself to an inbound call signal emitted by the OS.</br> 
When a call is inbound, BusyBee wakes up and takes the appropriate action for the call. After the call is managed, it returns back to being dormant. This ensures a very low battery footprint."

feature2Desc: "BusyBee, much like Hub10, uses k-medoids to cluster users. Priority and custom user groups override profile behavior and make sure that important calls always go through."
