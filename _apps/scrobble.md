quote0: " “Works perfectly, no tweaks, convoluted setup needed. No invasive private data access requests, either, unlike a lot of official apps.
​Would give ten stars if I could !.”"

feature0Desc: "scroBBle uses last.fm's data to retrieve your music history and extracts patterns.<br/><br/>
Using collaborative filtering and clustering, scroBBle builds recommendations for you - artists, tracks and albums that you'd probably love. The recommendations are roughly based on your current taste and have proved to work great for most users!"

feature1Desc: "
scroBBle works as a headless service, so you don't need to fire-up the app every time you are listening to music. It will start as soon as your music does and it will kill itself when all music based activity stops for a couple minutes.<br/>
​It goes easy on the CPU and maintains a very low battery footprint.
When running as a headless service, scroBBle will periodically keep you posted of it's activity with relevant notifications!"

It lets you dig through your music and find out more about artists, recent/loved tracks, charts, events around you!"
