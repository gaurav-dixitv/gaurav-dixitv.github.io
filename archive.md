Writing apps for Blackberry10 was an amazing experience. It was rewarding for two primary reasons - 
1. Sharing your project with people around the world and to see them use it is incredible!
2. Applying machine learning to real world problems is even better!

Most of my apps were a mix of Qt/QML and Cascades.
Down below are some of the apps I developed. Some I published, some I never finished.
