          I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a class="reference-url" href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~ktumer/people/">Autonomous Agents and Distributed Intelligence Lab</a> with <a class="reference-url" href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~ktumer/">Dr. Kagan Tumer</a> in <a class="reference-url" href="https://ai-caring.org/">the AI-Caring Institute</a>. I completed my PhD in Robotics and AI at <a class="reference-url" href="https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/CoRIS">Oregon State University</a>, where I developed learning and diversity-search techniques for cooperative multi-agent settings.

          My research is at the intersection of reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms, game theory, and ethics. Broadly, I am interested in developing methods that allow asymmetric agents — agents with distinct capabilities and objectives — to cooperate and work in teams with diverse partners.

          At the AI-Caring Institute, my work synthesizes multi-objective solution concepts that facilitate collective reasoning required to pursue high-level, long-term, dynamic, and potentially conflicting objectives such as an older adult’s independence and safety. This induces three distinct challenges: 1) Identifying the representative set of care coordination tasks, such as collaborative cleaning and health monitoring, that encapsulate the diverse responsibilities and interactions necessary for providing comprehensive care in a healthcare setting; 2) Inferring the core characteristics of the tasks such as the required agent capabilities, the associated objectives, tasks priorities and interdependence, and the expected cooperative outcomes to ensure wellbeing; and 3) Developing a coverage set of diverse trade-offs that account for the collective considerations of caregivers, healthcare provides and embodied agents.
